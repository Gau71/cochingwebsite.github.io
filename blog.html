		<article>
			<p>In 2023, we predict that car prices will rise due to increased demand for electric vehicles and a shortage of semiconductor chips. We also predict that the average price of a new car will increase by 10%. Here are our top 5 predictions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Electric vehicle prices will continue to rise due to increased demand and limited supply.</li>
				<li>Used car prices will continue to be high due to the shortage of new cars and the increase in demand.</li>
				<li>Luxury car prices will rise due to the high demand for premium features and limited production.</li>
				<li>Pickup truck prices will continue to be high due to the popularity of these vehicles.</li>
				<li>Sports car prices will rise due to the limited production and high demand.</li>
			</ol>

				<li><strong>John:</strong> I totally agree with your predictions. I'm looking to buy a new electric car, but the prices keep going up.</li>
				<li><strong>Mary:</</ol>
          <li><strong>Mary:</strong> I've been trying to find a used car for months now, and the prices are just crazy. It's like everyone is buying used cars instead of new ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Bob:</strong> I think you're spot on with the luxury car prediction. I've been waiting for months to get my hands on a new luxury SUV, but they're always sold out.</li>
          <li><strong>Emily:</strong> As someone who owns a pickup truck, I can confirm that the prices are crazy right now. It's definitely a seller's market.</li>
          <li><strong>Tom:</strong> I'm a sports car enthusiast, and I've been watching the prices of my favorite models go up and up. It's getting harder and harder to find a good deal.</li>
